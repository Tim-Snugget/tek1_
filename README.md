This is all my tek1 stuff

Please beware I had little to no experience in programming at the time.  
If you read thoroughly each program, you even will notice my progress curve ahah  
And if you are epitech students, please search the answers to your problems yourself and ask your AER and APE before copypasting my code (I didn't have to brightest GPA, so it has mistakes, the norme and moulinettes were probably different...).
